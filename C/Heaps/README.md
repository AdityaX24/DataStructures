## Heaps

A Heap can be defined as a Binary Tree with keys assigned to its node and provided that the following conditions are met:

1) **The tree's shape requirement:** The Binary Tree must be a complete binary tree. i.e. All the levels must be completely filled except the last level, which can be full, or have all the nodes on the far left side.
2) - **The Max Heap requirement:** The key of each node must be greater than or equal to the key of its children
    - **The Min Heap requirement:** The key of each node must be smaller than or equal to the key of its children
